# Fighting-Robot-Base

This Repository contains a 3D Fighting Robot Base, which shows at the end the final form of the fighting robotðŸ¤–ðŸ¦¾ from task 1 to this task (number 4) after assembling the pieces.

this is the fourth task of the program which is designing the base of the robot.

The base is designed from steel so it can be faster and strong at the same time. As a result, the robot's chance of won will increase. the base is designed with two pieces on top of each other to put the control circuits between the two pieces. Also, I chose the Omni wheels because they can move in all directions with their features.
